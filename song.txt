This is where the pain comes from
This is how the payback sounds
This is why the fire goes up
This is why the walls come down

You ain't never been in these shoes
Never know a word that I'm saying
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing
Is to let you know I'm not playing

I'mma see your lies exposed
I'mma see the justice done
I'mma see the sun come back
I'mma see the kingdome come
